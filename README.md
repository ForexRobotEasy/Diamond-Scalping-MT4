## Main Program

The main program is executed on every tick in the market. It consists of the following sections:

1. Market analysis tools: The current and previous price of the symbol are calculated to identify potential trading opportunities.
2. Entry and exit signals: Based on the algorithm, if the current price is higher than the previous price, a buy trade is placed. If the current price is lower than the previous price, a sell trade is placed.
3. Real-time monitoring: The account balance and equity are retrieved to monitor the trades and account balance.
4. Trade execution and order management: The `ManageTrades()` function is called to manage the open trades.
5. Printing account information: The account balance and equity are printed for monitoring purposes.

## Function Definitions

This section contains the definitions of various functions used in the main program:

1. `PlaceTrade(int tradeType)`: This function calculates the lot size based on risk management calculations and executes the trade using the `OrderSend()` function. It also checks for trade execution success and prints the relevant information.
2. `ManageTrades()`: This function iterates over all open orders and closes them if necessary. If an open order is a buy trade and it is in profit, it is closed. If an open order has a stop loss and the current market price crosses the stop loss level, it is also closed. The function uses the `OrderClose()` function to close the orders.
3. `CalculateLotSize()`: This function calculates the lot size based on a risk percentage and the account balance. It uses the `SymbolInfoDouble()` function to retrieve symbol-specific information such as ask price, bid price, and margin required.
